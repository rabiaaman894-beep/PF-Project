Assignment and Deadline Management System / 1st Semester Project of Programming Fundamentals _ CS 102

This Assignment & Deadline Management System is a simple C++ console-based program designed to help users manage assignments efficiently using file handling. 
The program allows users to add new assignments with deadlines, view all saved assignments, mark assignments as completed, and automatically load previously saved data from a file (assignments.txt) when the program starts. It uses arrays for data storage, functions for modular design, and basic input/output operations, making it suitable for beginners learning C++ fundamentals. e.g. file handling.
